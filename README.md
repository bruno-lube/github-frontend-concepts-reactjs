# github-frontend-concepts-reactjs
Simplified React Frontend for the api that simulates in memory CRUD operations on Github Repositories

This frontend ReactJS project is the result of the second challenge proposed inside RocketSeat GoStack bootcamp.

When the frontend is loaded, it gets the repositories from the Api, if there is any.

The frontend has a hardcoded repository information that sent to the Api everytime the "Adicionar" button is clicked.
(The button has this name because RocketSeat Jest test needs to find the buttons by their names)

The "Remover" button removes the repository.
